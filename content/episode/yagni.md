description: Are you building custom software? Are you adding extra features to work tool? Maybe "you aren't gonna need it". In this episode we debate using off the shelf software vs. building your own. Is your company actually selling software? What is your business model? We also discuss unnecessary complexity in software and the impact this can have on quality.
