## Outline

  * Software development is not a "game", i.e. you aren't aiming to get more points
  * Points give you a reference for how your people, process & technology are working together
  * Velocity therefore is a function with these inputs
  * Estimation is possible through a "Stable Velocity"
  * Estimates aren't meant to be used to hide behind
  * Fixed estimates aren't really possible as the number of variables in a project consistently change
  * Developers need to deteremine their lifestyle. Maybe using points is not the right thing for your team
