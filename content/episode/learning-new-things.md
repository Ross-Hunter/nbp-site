title: Learning New Things
date: 2018-03-30T12:00:00-04:00
description: In this episode we talk about learning new things. We discuss what got us interested in software in the first place, and how those original motivations still color how we approach learning. Should we learn new things just because we read about them on Hacker News? Should we dive deep and become an expert in a field, or is it just more fun to do new and different things?
